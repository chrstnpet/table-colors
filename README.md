# Description

In the index.html file there is a table that displays dummy information about some people.

## style.css 
The CSS file includes some styling for the "cleared" look of the table.

## script.js
This file has jQuery code which makes changes when the user clicks on the 'Next' and 'Clear' buttons. Specifically:
- Button Next: Upon clicking thet button, the next data row (not the header row) is highlighted by changing its font color to red and the previous row returns to black color. Initially no row is highlighted.
- Button Clear: Upon clicking the button all rows return to black color.
